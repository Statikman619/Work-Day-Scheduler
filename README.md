For this week’s homework assignment we had to finish a code to create a schedule planner. When you click on the planner you’re presented with the present day at the top. You have multiple time blocks that show you the past, present, or future. When you click on any time block you’re able to write any text hit the save button but when you click refresh the event is still saved in your time block.
